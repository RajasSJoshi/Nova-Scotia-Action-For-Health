    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Imports\n",
    "- **`from sqlalchemy import create_engine`**: Imports the `create_engine` function from sqlalchemy. This function is essential for creating a connection engine that allows Python to interact with a SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables\n",
    "- **`server_name`**: `'DESKTOP-0N0LQTG'` \n",
    "- **`database_name`**: `'Nova_Scotia_Action_For_Health'`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constructing Connection String\n",
    "- Constructs a connection string using Python's f-string formatting:\n",
    "  - `mssql+pyodbc://`: Specifies the dialect and driver to use (MSSQL with PyODBC driver).\n",
    "  - `{server_name}/{database_name}`: Specifies the server and database to connect to.\n",
    "  - `trusted_connection=yes`: Indicates Windows authentication should be used, where the current Windows credentials are used to authenticate.\n",
    "  - `driver=ODBC+Driver+17+for+SQL+Server`: Specifies the ODBC driver to use for the connection. Adjust this according to the version of the ODBC driver installed on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating the Engine\n",
    "- Uses the `create_engine` function from sqlalchemy to create an engine (`engine`) object:\n",
    "  - The `connection_string` is passed as an argument to `create_engine`, configuring the engine to connect to the specified SQL Server instance and database using the specified authentication method and driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing the Connection\n",
    "- Attempts to establish a connection to the SQL Server database using the `engine.connect()` method:\n",
    "  - If the connection is successful (`with` block), it prints \"Connection successful!\".\n",
    "  - If an exception occurs during the connection attempt (e.g., authentication error, network issue), the `except` block catches the exception (`Exception as e`), and it prints \"Connection failed: \" followed by the error message (`str(e)`).\n"
